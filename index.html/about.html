            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Born in Kerala and raised in Chennai, I am an ambitious individual with a deep passion for both technology and creativity. I completed my 10th grade at St. John's Matriculation Higher Secondary School with a 91% score, followed by achieving 93% in my 12th grade at Jaigopal Garodia Higher Secondary School. Throughout my school years, I won numerous medals in athletics at both school and interschool levels, along with awards for my creative endeavors.</p>
            <p>Art has always been a significant part of my life, leading to a personal collection of over 500 hand-drawn images. Though I shifted from being extroverted to more introverted at the age of 15, I still enjoy meeting new people and have connected with individuals from over 20 countries through phone conversations.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Business Systems at Rajalakshmi Engineering College, focusing on web development and design. In addition, I am working on building my own agency, Criativo, which provides creative and tech services to clients. My goal is to scale the agency further by assembling a strong team.</p>
            <p>As an Indian, I am driven by an unyielding desire to live an extraordinary life, striving to be among the top 1% of achievers. My ambitions are fueled by inspirations such as Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates, who have all transformed their industries through innovation. I am committed to continuous learning and personal growth, not only in business but also in life. My routine includes regular visits to the gym, which helps me maintain focus and discipline.</p>
            <p>In addition to my professional pursuits, I am passionate about traveling and dream of exploring as many countries as possible, combining my love for creativity, technology, and global culture.</p>
